## QIIME2 Progress üë©‚Äçüç≥
Ellie
- Made directory
- Initial attempt at importing

Negar
- Importing wasn't loading files so imported and demultiplexed using manifest file (used manifest.txt file, it worked!)
- Viewed demux.qzv file on viewer and chose trimming parameters
- Denoised/clustered (took many hours!)
- Visualized table.qza, rep-seqs.qza and stats.qza as .qzv files
- Uploaded progress to date as QIIME_Code.txt file

Hannah
- Replaced primer sequences for V1-V3 (found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8544895/))
- f primer: AGAGTTTGATYMTGGCTCAG
- r primer: ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG
- Trained the classifier with the new ref-seqs file
- Ran the toxonomic analysis (took almost 24 hours!)
- taxonomy.qza was visualized and looks correct
- uploaded progress on QIIME_Code.txt
