#### Heat Maps
**Figure 1. Heat Map of Soil Classification and CN Ratio.** To get an overview of the relationship between soil classification and CN ratio, a contingency table was created and visualized as a heatmap. Aquic Glossudualfs appears to correlate most with a CN Ratio of 10-20, while Orthic Humo-Ferric Podzal correlates most with a CN ratio of 30-40. The remaining soil classifications correlate most with a CN ratio of 20-30.

**Figure 2. Heat Map of Soil Classification and Compaction Treatment.** To get an overview of the relationship between soil classification and compaction treatment, a contingency table was created and visualized as a heatmap. Aquic Glossudalfs, Mesic Ultic Haploxeraifs, and Orthic Humo-Ferric Podzal correlate most with C0. The remaining soil classifications don't appear to correlate with a particular compaction treatment.

**Figure 3. Heat Map of Soil Classification and LTSP Treatment.** To get an overview of the relationship between soil classification and LTSP treatment, a contingency table was created and visualized as a heatmap. The majority of soil classifications appear to correlate most with OM1 and OM2. The exceptions are Mesic Ultic Haploxeraifs (which appears to correlates most with REF) and Gleyed Dystric Brunisol (which doesn't appear to have any correlation).

**Figure 4. Heat Map of Soil Classification and pH.** To get an overview of the relationship between soil classification and pH, a contingency table was created and visualized as a heatmap. Aquic Glossudalfs, Gleyed Eluviated Dystric Brunisol, and Orthic Humo-Ferric Podzol are most correlated with a pH of 5. Brunisolic Gray Luvisol, Gleyed Gray Luvisol, Mesic Ultic Haploseralfs, Orthic Dystric Brunisol, and Orthic Gray Luvisol are most correlated with a pH of 6. Gleyed Dystric Brunisol does not appear to be correlated with a specific pH. 

**Figure 5. Heat Map of Soil Classification and Tree Cover.** To get an overview of the relationship between soil classification and tree cover, a contingency table for was created and visualized as a heatmap. The highest correlations occur between Aquic Glossudalfs with Yaupon, Wax Myrtle, Sweetgum, Oaks, Loblolly Pine, and Beautyberry; and Brunisolic Gray Luvisol with Douglas Fir. Interestingly, Gleyed Dystric Brunisol is only correlated with Black Spruceâ€”other soil classifications are correlated with multiple tree covers.
