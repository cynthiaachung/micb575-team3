## Rarefaction Curve with R
Looks different from QIIME. So a Phyloseq object with the previous rarefaction parameter (2526) is created and another one using 1500 arbitrarly to lose less samples
Both phyloseq objects are used to create curves

- First attempt at plots
- Richness
  - Shows too much variability amongst same soil type
  - Bessie suggested to control for other variables first
