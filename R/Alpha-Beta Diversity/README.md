## Rarefaction Curve with R

Looks different from QIIME. So a Phyloseq object with the previous rarefaction parameter (2526) is created and another one using 1500 arbitrarly to lose less samples
Both phyloseq objects are used to create curves

## Alpha Diversity

### Richness and Evenness

**Data Needs to be Filtered to select for other metadata categories because there is too much variability in the richness data as shown here**
*Compaction Treatment - Richness (Not Filtered)*

## Mar 13
- First attempt at plots
- Richness
  - Shows too much variability amongst same soil type
  - Bessie suggested to control for other variables first
