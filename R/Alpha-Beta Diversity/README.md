## Rarefaction Curve with R

Looks different from QIIME. So a Phyloseq object with the previous rarefaction parameter (2526) is created and another one using 1500 arbitrarly to lose less samples
Both phyloseq objects are used to create curves
![Rarefaction Curve Generated by R](https://github.com/cynthiaachung/micb575-team3/blob/main/R/Alpha-Beta%20Diversity/Rarefaction%20Curve%20from%20R)
Rarefaction parameters:
- Rare1 = 2526
- Rare2 = 1500

## Alpha Diversity

### Filter Data
**First, the data needs to select for other metadata categories because there is too much variability in the richness data as shown here**

*Compaction Treatment - Richness (Not Filtered) - Rare1*

*Soil Classification - Richness (Not Filtered) - Rare2*

# Done so far
## Mar 13
- First attempt at plots
- Richness
  - Shows too much variability amongst same soil type
  - Bessie suggested to control for other variables first
