## Rarefaction Curve with R

Looks different from QIIME. So a Phyloseq object with the previous rarefaction parameter (2526) is created and another one using 1500 arbitrarly to lose less samples
Both phyloseq objects are used to create curves
![Rarefaction Curve Generated by R](https://github.com/cynthiaachung/micb575-team3/blob/main/R/Alpha-Beta%20Diversity/Rarefaction%20Curve%20from%20R)
Rarefaction parameters:
- Rare1 = 2526
- Rare2 = 1500

_I will be using Rare1 data for the plots below, unless I see very little data shown in the plots, then I will change to Rare2 and do the plots all again, but for now, only Rare1 is used_

## Alpha Diversity

### We Must First Control for other Variables!!!
**Here is how the RICHNESS plots looks without controlling for other variables, there is too much variability, so we should control for other variables**

*Compaction Treatment - Richness (Not Controlled) - Rare1*


![Richness Not Filtered](https://github.com/cynthiaachung/micb575-team3/blob/main/R/Alpha-Beta%20Diversity/plot_richness_compac_not_filtered.png)

*Soil Classification - Richness (Not Controlled) - Rare1*


![Richness Not Filtered](https://github.com/cynthiaachung/micb575-team3/blob/main/R/Alpha-Beta%20Diversity/plot_richness_not_filtered.png)

**Explanation:**
According to the Richness plots above, we can see a large number of points outside the boxplots, indicating that there is a large range of alpha diversity measures within each soil classification OR compaction treatment. This suggests that we need to explore controlling for other variables that make affect alpha diversity measures such as "Site", "Hebacide Use"...



### Richness and Evenness
The goal here is to first select for other variables before plotting alpha diversity richness plots

(note: I am still having issues controlling for variables... working on these plots so to be continued...)



### Phylogentic Diversity

*Soil Classification - Phylogenetic Diversity (Not Controlled) - Rare1*![Phylogenetic Diversity](https://github.com/cynthiaachung/micb575-team3/blob/main/R/Alpha-Beta%20Diversity/plot_pd.png)
**Explanation:**  Visually we can see that the box plots for soil type phylogenetic diversity have some variability in phylogenetic diversity, most notably the group "Orthic Gray Luvisol, Gleyed Gray Luvisol". However we need to do statistical analysis to see if this difference is significant.

(stats to be continued...)

*Compaction Treatment - Phylogenetic Diversity (Not Controlled) - Rare1*![Phylogenetic Diversity](https://github.com/cynthiaachung/micb575-team3/blob/main/R/Alpha-Beta%20Diversity/plot_pd_compac.png)
**Explanation:**  Visually we can see that the box plots for compaction treatment phylogenetic diversity have very little difference in their median values. However we need to do statistical analysis to check if there might be any significant difference.

(stats to be continued...)

## Beta Diversity
### PCOA Plot - Bray-Curtis (Richness and Abundance/Eveness)

*Soil Classification - Beta Diversity PCOA plots*![Beta Diversity - PCOA plots](https://github.com/cynthiaachung/micb575-team3/blob/main/R/Alpha-Beta%20Diversity/plot_pcoa.png)

**Explanation:**  This plot really highlights that: 
- Soil Classification "Aquic Glossudalfs" has microbial communities that are different from the other groups.
- "Brunisolic Gray Luvisol" and "Orthis Gray Luvisol, Gleyed Gray Luvisol" are very close to eachother and are both farther away than other groups
- The rest of the soil types each have a specific cluster but overlap somewhat
- It is worth to note that "NA" forms a tight cluster indicating that they may all be similar soil types
(stats to be continued...)


*Compaction Treatment - Beta Diversity PCOA plots*![Beta Diversity - PCOA plots](https://github.com/cynthiaachung/micb575-team3/blob/main/R/Alpha-Beta%20Diversity/plot_pcoa_compac.png)

**Explanation:**  This plot shows visually that: 
- compaction treatment C0 and REF are very similar and compaction treatments C1 and C2 are farther away in terms of beta diversity.
- Important to note that there are a few red (C0) and purple (REF) points that are positioned close the C1 and C2.
- There are also not that many data points for C1 and C2
(stats to be continued...)


## Taxonomy bar plots

*Soil Classification - Taxa Bar Plots - Phylum*![Taxa-Phylum Plots](https://github.com/cynthiaachung/micb575-team3/blob/main/R/Alpha-Beta%20Diversity/plot_taxaphylum.png)


*Soil Classification - Taxa Bar Plots - Class*![Taxa-Class Plots](https://github.com/cynthiaachung/micb575-team3/blob/main/R/Alpha-Beta%20Diversity/plot_taxaclass.png)

(stats to come...)

# Done so far
## Mar 13
- First attempt at plots
- Richness
  - Shows too much variability amongst same soil type
  - Bessie suggested to control for other variables first
