Figure 4 (vol_plot C0,C1,C2). Increasing compaction level drove increasing differences in abundance of taxa. Differential abundance was performed using DESeq on bacterial genera for all compaction levels (C0-C1). Left to right show differential abundance of bacterial genera for C0, C1, and C2 respectively . For all three plots the control reference plot was used when calculating differential abundance. The differential abundance was graphed into volcano plots with the x-axis (log2FoldChange) showing the magnitude of change of the feature in comparison to the reference. The y-axis (-log10(padj)) shows the statistical significance difference in abundance. The significant points were also highlighted in teal with the non-significant points shown in red using p < 0.01 to indicate significance.
