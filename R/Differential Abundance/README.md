# Figure 4. Increasing compaction level drove increasing differences in abundance of taxa

There are three ASVs that are the same across soil classifications.

Red is non-significant, blue is signifcant. All are compared to reference. On the left is decrease in abundance and right is increase in abundnace with the dotted line showing 0. Plot 0 = C0. plot 1 = C1, plot 2 = C2.
